## Amplifier and detector blocks
 This design contains um amplifier circuit with AC a
 
 The passive detector circuit has a NMOS transistor,coupling capacitor at the input and an RC filter at the output. 
 The filter has a cuttof frequency of 150 kHz. 




Refer to [README](docs/source/index.rst) for this sample project documentation.
